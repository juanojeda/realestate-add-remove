# Code demo: Add and remove properties from a list

This demo showcases fetching from a mock database, displaying two lists of properties, and adding and removing properties between lists.

It uses React as a component/view library, Redux for state management, Sass for styling, and Jest, Enzyme and Chai-Enzyme for unit testing.

For development it uses gulp and webpack to build assets, and serves them with browsersync.
